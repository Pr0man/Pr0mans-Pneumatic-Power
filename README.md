# Pr0mans-Pneumatic-Power
This mod will be an overhaul and addition to the pneumatic guns in the fork "Cataclysm: Bright Nights".

It is aimed to rebalance existing air guns and add a plethora of new ones so you can create your very own arsenal of powerful air guns, either via compression or spring-loading.
As of right now, the mod is very much WIP and more of a concept than a fully-fledged content addition.
